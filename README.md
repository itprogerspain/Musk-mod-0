# My First GitHub Repository

## About This Project
Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! I created this project to learn the basics of Git and get familiar with GitHub. This is my starting point in exploring version control and sharing code online.

## Goals
- Understand how Git works (cloning, committing, pushing, etc.).
- Get comfortable with GitHub features like repositories, branches, and README files.
- Practice writing and formatting a `README.md` using Markdown.

## What I’ve Learned So Far
- How to initialize a Git repository with `git init`.
- Adding files to the staging area with `git add`.
- Committing changes with `git commit`.
- Pushing my work to GitHub with `git push`.
- Writing a basic `README.md` to describe my project.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with branches and pull requests.
- Collaborate on open-source projects.
- Build more complex projects to showcase here.
